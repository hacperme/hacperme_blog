## Hunter's comment

If you love those open source hardware projects, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, you may also love this product - ScopeFun too.

ScopeFun is an open source Oscilloscope. Especially, its software, firmware, and hardware all are open source. That's amazing. If you want to know how it works, you can build it yourself. Because all of the sources are available for free.

ScopeFun is not just an instrument as Oscilloscope, actually, it is a Waveform Generator, Spectrum Analyzer, Logic Analyzer and Pattern Generator. That's really awesome, right?

I like this product because:

- Fully open source, software, firmware, and hardware.
- Multi instruments all in one board.
- Cross-platform, runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

More specifications please check it out its official website [here](https://www.scopefun.com/). Hope you like this hunt, thanks.
